# Single cell RNA annotation model

## Project

This is a bachelor thesis in Computer Science at KTH. 

We are creating an auto-annotation of celltypes, which aims to label celltypes automatically given our trained model. 

## Method

1. Preprocessing
2. Filtering 
3. Training 
4. Predictions on test data

## Data

https://cellxgene.cziscience.com is where we gather our datasets that are used for training the model.

These datasets have been created by Linnarsson labs project: https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/adult-human-brain/tree/main/cytograph/annotation
