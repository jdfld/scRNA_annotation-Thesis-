# Single cell RNA annotation model

## Project

This is a bachelor thesis in Computer Science at KTH. 

We have created an auto-annotation model regarding cells, given specific gene-expressions. 

## Method

## Data

https://cellxgene.cziscience.com is where we gather our datasets that are used for training the model.

These datasets have been created by Linnarsson labs project: https://github.com/linnarsson-lab/adult-human-brain/tree/main/cytograph/annotation
